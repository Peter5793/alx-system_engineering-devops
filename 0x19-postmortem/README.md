# DevOps Postmortems

The content in the link will discuss the motivation behind introducing a postmortem culture into a DevOps Organization.

## Why
With changes in the systems instabilities can be be introduced, which may couse varous incidents.

Making small release in smaller increments and with greater frequencies, reduced the risk of failure, however the increasing number of releases may increase the number of incidents the on-call teams need to respond to.

The major aim of the response team is to quantify and mitigate the impact.

### Conducting a Postmortem
To avoid a spiral, the team meeds to learn from the past to better the future. With the learning process being called the postnorterm. It should be triggered whenever an incident requires a response from an on-call engineer. The following are the processes to start the post-mortem:
   1. Trigger for the incident
   2. Impact of the incident
   3. Time taken to detect and mitigate
   4. Steps taken to mitigate
   5. Root cause analysis
